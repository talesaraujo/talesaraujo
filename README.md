Hi there! I am a Computer-Engineering Bachelor at Universidade Federal do CearÃ¡ and Software Developer at DELL Lead. I hold a great interest in learning, as well as Data Science and Machine Learning itself, CS fields I consider myself as an enthusiast. I tend to think I am a Python lover, but let's say I know my way around when it comes to other languages. My hope is that I can work and contribute to an awesome project or something that brings major positive impacts on people's lives, as well as in my own personal growth and experience.
